### Hi there 👋

Hey there, I'm Vishnu Haridas, currently building solutions at [QBurst ME](https://qburst.com/). 

Visit my [blog](https://iamvishnu.com/) to read my thoughts on tech, life, and everything in between.

Here are a few things that I built out of passion:

 * [**April⋅SSG**](https://github.com/vishnuharidas/april-ssg) - A lightweight static site generator that I built to power my personal blog. [See why I built this.](https://iamvishnu.com/posts/why-i-built-april-static-site-generator)
 * [**UTF-8 Playground**](https://github.com/vishnuharidas/utf8-playground) - After learning about UTF-8, I wanted a simple tool to compose characters by simply picking the binary sequence. There were no tools I could find, so I built this.
    * See it in action: [utf8-playground.netlify.app](https://utf8-playground.netlify.app/).
    * Also read my popular post on why [UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design](https://iamvishnu.com/posts/utf8-is-brilliant-design)
  

Other things (mostly vibe-coded since I could):

  * [HN Reels](https://vishnuharidas.github.io/hn-reels/) - A reels-kind scrollable view of Hacker News
  * [Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn Map](https://tropics-map.netlify.app/) - A simple map tool to visualize the tropical lines, and the subsolar point. Mainly built to find a location that I can visit on summer solstice of 2025 (June 21st) 
  * [RPM Visualizer](https://vishnuharidas.github.io/rpm-visualizer/) - Simply built to get an idea of how certain RPMs look like.
  * [Covered Call Profit Calculator](https://covered-call-calculator.netlify.app/) - Another quick-vibe-coded tool to calculate profits when trading covered calls in BSE/NSE markets.
